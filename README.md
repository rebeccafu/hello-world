# hello-world

Hi! I'm Rebecca ðŸ‘‹. I am currently a junior at Cornell University studying Applied Economics and Management with an intended minor in Information Science. After 2 years of being surrounded by the world of business and finance, I wanted an outlet to be creative. I'm hoping to learn more about web design and programming through my GitHub account! But outside of learning, I love to dance, play tennis, and browse the sales section at Urban Outfitters.
